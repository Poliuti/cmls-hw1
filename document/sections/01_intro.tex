\section{Introduction}

The aim of this document is to describe the realization of a regressor able to predict the mood of a music piece. In particular, in accordance with the Music Emotion Recognition (MER) theory, we used a dimensional approach to face this problem. We considered two "emotion dimensions" to describe emotions: the \emph{valence}, that describes the grade of pleasantness, and the \emph{arousal}, which represents the level of energy.

The DEAM Dataset was provided to us. We considered extracts of music pieces, already re-encoded to have the same duration of and the same sampling frequency. The annotations related to these songs contain the mean values and the standard deviation for both valence and arousal. The DEAM Dataset also contains, for each piece, a set of values for already extracted features, as the zero crossing rate, the spectrum centroid,.. This aspects will be analyzed in detail in \hyperref[sec:music database]{section 2}.

The first step of our research was the \textbf{feature selection}: we studied the usefulness of the provided data and we extracted other features using the Librosa library in order to have a wider choice. Then we split the dataset to obtain a training and a test set. The next step was to implement the \textbf{regressors}, trying with some kind of them with different parameters in order to find the best choice. The last step was the \textbf{evaluation} of the prediction, using as metrics the mean squared error and the $R^2$-score.

In the following sections we will analyze in detail our workflow and the tests that led us to our solution of this problem. The document is divided in parts, each one of them describes a different topic we considered for our choices but they depends on each other in same ways, so the flow of this paper does not reflect our chronological approach. Further details can be found in the Jupyter Notebook containing the results of our experiment \cite{notebook} and in the GitHub repository of this assignment \cite{github}.
